        <h4>France Declares National Party Month a Sacred Institution</h4>
<!-- Change article ipsum-->
        <p>This is glass grade. I mean, you got... Jesus, you got crystals in here 2 inches, 3 inches long. This is pure glass. You're a damn artist! This is art, Mr. White! Yeah, that's the thing, y'know? Your scumbag brother-in-law took my rainy day fund. Oh yeah. And tell that douche bag brother-in-law of yours to go towards the light.   </p>

        <p>Got something for me? Is this a five or an S? Jesus, how the hell do you spell street wrong - S T R E A T? Spooge. Not mad dog, not diesel... let me get this straight, you got jacked by a guy named Spooge?  </p>

        <p>Where's my money... bitch? WHERE'S my money. Where's my. Where's MY money, bitch? Huh? Bitch? Where's my money, bitch? Oh that's good... where's my money. Where's my money, bitch. Bitch, where's my money. I will mess you... up. That how you wanna play this?  Huh, Your call, your funeral Jack. Hey, do not mess with me I will bury you cause I'm crazy. You know, yeah... mucho loco. Do not... test me.  </p>

        <p>Where's my money, bitch?! I ain't gonna keep asking nice. Yo, alright? I want my money and my dope. Come on! What, what! What do you wanna say? Shut up! Shut... up!  </p>

        <p>You didn't actually see Tuco? You got this money from Tuco? Tuco gave you this is what you're saying? You made a deal? How... why would you make a deal with that scumbag? You see what he did to me? No way man, okay, no understanding! Without even talking to me, you told this... insane ass-clown, dead-eyed killer, that uh... that we would give him two pounds a week? </p>

        <p>Don't talk to me about hours, what about sudo, man? How are we gonna get that? You think the meth fairy is gonna just bring it to us? God it takes me a week to get this stuff. I'm driving all the way up to Las Cruces, two hundred miles each way to meet up with my Smurfs. The dudes who go to the drug stores and get a couple boxes at a time and then sell 'em to me. And that's maybe only good for, like a half pound worth. See that's the bottle neck in your brilliant business plan. Of course you would've known that if you would've just asked me. </p>

        <p>At first I thought to myself 'Hell yeah, bitch. Now give me a D and shut up so I can go blaze one with my boys.' I don't know. Maybe it was the way he said it, but... it was like he wasn't exactly saying it sucked. He was just asking me honestly, 'Is that all you got?' And for some reason, I thought to myself: 'Yeah, man, I can do better.' </p>

And for some reason, I thought to myself: 'Yeah, man, I can do better.' </p>

        <p>So I started from scratch. I made another, then another. And by the end of the semester, by like box number five, I had built this thing. You should have seen it. It was insane. I mean, I built it out of Peruvian walnut with inlaid zebrawood. It was fitted with pegs, no screws, I sanded it for days, until it was smooth as glass. Then I rubbed all the wood with tung oil so it was rich and dark. It even smelled good. You know, you put nose in it and breathed in, it was... it was perfect. </p>

      It's ok. You be with Yam. She tried pesto for the first time. Imagine that, 92 years old and she never tried pesto. I'm sure Egg is a great person. So, what do you say?
