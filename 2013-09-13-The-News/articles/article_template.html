        <p>Now that there is the Tec-9, a crappy spray gun from South Miami. This gun is advertised as the most popular gun in American crime. Do you believe that shit? It actually says that in the little book that comes with it: the most popular gun in American crime. Like they're actually proud of that shit.  </p>

        <p>Now that we know who you are, I know who I am. I'm not a mistake! It all makes sense! In a comic, you know how you can tell who the arch-villain's going to be? He's the exact opposite of the hero. And most times they're friends, like you and me! I should've known way back when... You know why, David? Because of the kids. They called me Mr Glass. </p>

        <p>Look, just because I don't be givin' no man a foot massage don't make it right for Marsellus to throw Antwone into a glass motherfuckin' house, fuckin' up the way the nigger talks. Motherfucker do that shit to me, he better paralyze my ass, 'cause I'll kill the motherfucker, know what I'm sayin'? </p>

        <p>My money's in that office, right? If she start giving me some bullshit about it ain't there, and we got to go someplace else and get it, I'm gonna shoot you in the head then and there. Then I'm gonna shoot that bitch in the kneecaps, find out where my goddamn money is. She gonna tell me too. Hey, look at me when I'm talking to you, motherfucker. You listen: we go in there, and that nigga Winston or anybody else is in there, you the first motherfucker to get shot. You understand? </p>

        <p>Your bones don't break, mine do. That's clear. Your cells react to bacteria and viruses differently than mine. You don't get sick, I do. That's also clear. But for some reason, you and I react the exact same way to water. We swallow it too fast, we choke. We get some in our lungs, we drown. However unreal it may seem, we are connected, you and I. We're on the same curve, just on opposite ends. </p>

        <p>Look, just because I don't be givin' no man a foot massage don't make it right for Marsellus to throw Antwone into a glass motherfuckin' house, fuckin' up the way the nigger talks. Motherfucker do that shit to me, he better paralyze my ass, 'cause I'll kill the motherfucker, know what I'm sayin'? </p>

        <p>You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves like it has a mind. Like it knows it killed the world once and got a taste for murder. After the avalanche, it took us a week to climb out. Now, I don't know exactly when we turned on each other, but I know that seven of us survived the slide... and only five made it out. Now we took an oath, that I'm breaking now. We said we'd say it was the snow that killed the other two, but it wasn't. Nature is lethal but it doesn't hold a candle to man. </p>

        <p>Your bones don't break, mine do. That's clear. Your cells react to bacteria and viruses differently than mine. You don't get sick, I do. That's also clear.

      That's so you can videotape it when they put you in a naked pyramid and point to your Charlie Browns. Michael was having brunch with Sally Sitwell at a restaurant called Skip Church's Bistro. In addition to brunch, the restaurant was known for an item on the menu called the "Skip's Scramble", an omelet that contained everything on the menu. Do not order the Skip's Scramble. Happy Franklin Friday. So did you see the new Poof? So you take your mom to work every day? Bummer. Moms are such a pain in the ass, huh? It's, like, die already!

      It's as Ann as the nose on Plain's face. Those are balls. Everybody dance NOW. Smack of ham. What is she doing at a beauty pageant? Is she running the lights or something? I was hoping he would be gifted sexually. Hey, maybe you could pop a tent outside with your cousin Maeby… it'd be a good chance to rub off on her. I'm an ideas man, Michael. I think I proved that with "F**k Mountain."

      She's not 'that Mexican', Mom. She's my Mexican. And she's Colombian or something. Second-of-ly, I know you're the big marriage expert. Oh I'm sorry, I forgot, your wife is dead. Do you have any idea how often you say the word afraid? Well, I know I used it in the Jacuzzi. No, Pop-pop does not get a treat, I just brought you a [bleep]ing pizza. It looks like you've been looking for dragons… in the future. You're blowing my mind, Frank.

      Well, I spent so much time making sweet love on my wife that it's hard to hear anything over the clatter of her breasts. The guy runs a prison, he can have any piece of ass he wants.

      I'm in Vegas this week and would like to point out the Blue Man Group is *actually* hiring. The support group? I know what an erection feels like, Michael. Go ahead, touch the Cornballer. Turn this skiff around! There are very few intelligent, attractive and straight men in this town. Well, that certainly leaves me out.
